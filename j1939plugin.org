1. Problem to solve?
   1. Stock gmbh openSYDE J1939 functionality does not include things we need for our customers
2. Solution?
   1. The software is open source, we have the resources, we will make a plugin to openSYDE with the features our customers need.

***** Current Project State [2024-01-22 Mon 08:25]
+ Epic OPSYD-16 MVP CLOSED
+ Epic OPSYD-17 2.0 OPEN
+ Primary is TG.  SC has been added to project and onboarding.
  + Currently TG is on PTO until [2024-01-24 Wed] .  SC will review Qt project, J1939 code so far, and J1939 standards while TG is out.
***** TODO Qt Creator 12 STW [4/5] [2024-01-22 Mon 07:53]
- [X] Review Jira status (Backlog tab) for OpenSyde Plugins (J1939) [[https://stwtechnic.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/OPSYD/boards/27/backlog][jira task]]
- [X] 30,000 ft code review of J1939 plugin code
- [X] Create running Question & Answer list (QnA)
- [X] Do a light review of built-in openCAN message handling using Qt Creator IDE.
- [ ] Select and begin viewing a Qt Creator tutorial playlist to familiarize with the IDE
  - special attention to SLOTS, SIGNALS, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHd5Ga8uihE][signals and slots]] example.
    - will look something like:
     #+begin_src C++
       QObject::connect (slider, &QSlider::valueChanged, spinBox, &QSpinBox::setValue);
     #+end_src
    - 'connect' = method,
    - 'slider' = sender of the message
    - '&QSlider::valueChanged' = the specific signal the sender will transmit 
    - 'spinBox' = reciever of the message
    - '&QSpinBox::setValue' = the specific slot opened up by the reciever to store the signal
    - you can connect multiple signals to one slot, you can also connect one signal to multiple slots.  Neither object needs to know anything about the other object to work this way.
  - take close look at j1939dbc.cpp, parsing J1939 DBC text from xml?
***** TODO QnA List [1/2]
- [ ] QSTRING, going to be a major function used here?
- [X] Jira, what is the current sprint for this project right now?
  - tasks = small portions completable by one person, in a day?
  - stories = larger scope, can be multiple team, multiple people,
  - hierarchy = Initiative or Project -> Epic(s) -> Stories -> Tasks -> Subtasks -> *Bugs
  - Jira Docs [[https://confluence.atlassian.com/advancedroadmapsserver0329/configuring-initiatives-and-other-hierarchy-levels-1021218664.html][hierarchy]]
  - Currently on Epic OPSYD-17 2.0

+ Current Epic has 9/17 issues in Backlog.
  + most issues fall under either UI or features to finish in the plugin code
  + otherwise tasks fall under J1939 hierarchy of DBC, PGN, or SPN related tasks.
  + Q?: While TG is out, review stock openCAN message handling inside Qt Creator as reference for J1939?
  + Qt docs are good, but also some 3rd party tutorials available, see [[https://www.cleanqt.io/blog/crash-course-in-qt-for-c%2B%2B-developers,-part-1][cleanqt.io]]
  + other frequently used Qt methods in the J1939 plug-in:
    + QFile, QIODevice, QDomNodeList, QDomElement, QDomDocument, QObject, QDir, QFileDialog
  + OpenSYDE canOpen tools in 'bus_edit' section.  Reviews Signals methods in bus_edit.

***** Focus on Qt Creator 12 today
+ Very robust documentation.  Lots of tutorials, examples, help files, etc.  Also many third party learning resources.
+ Primary: start with Qt internal documentation.
  + Find 3-4 tutorial or example projects suitable for STW (desktop application, xml / csv parsing, file handling, etc)
  + Track notes on Qt examples here in .org file.
  + Create a running list of QnA for TG / JG / AR as progress through the documentation
  + MAYBE? Try to identify Qt elements used by stock openSYDE canOPEN signals UI.
+ Secondary resource, pay special attention to YT channel @KDABtv and @VoidRealms.
+ NOTE: Qt Creator installation necessary for J1939 plugin does not include resources used in the built in examples.  To follow examples, may need to install more components.
+ NOTE: So many learning tools require latest Qt.  Leaving 5.15.2 installed on STW laptop for production, co-installing 6.6 on personal laptop, + all tools for training.
***** Qt Creator Example 1: (on hold while setting up training laptop)
****** INTERMEDIATE PROJECT: Find info on string parsing DBC if possible.
+ Web based DBC editing tool by CSS [[https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/dbc-editor-can-bus-database][link]]
+ Find a source of sample DBC files to test with off line, off IDE, just use regex to experiment.
+ Good info from copperhill media as well

+ Went back to our code after getting more familiar with Qt.
+ Compiled and ran most recent J1939, this time kept console window open while navigating openSYDE.
+ Noticed Qt errors when in trying to define new system.  Half dozen missing .svg icon elements.  Didn't notice first time compiling.
+ Found matching name .svg's in a previous .zip project.  Copied them over the the folder structure in the Qt Warning / Errors.
+ Recompiled and ran.  No problems.  Continued to define a system, add node, add bus, enable J1939 datapool, and edit J1939 message from Bus interface.
+ stopped here.

***** Recap missing SVG's
+ Problem: Qt Creator Application Output:
  - qt.svg: Cannot open file 'C:/stw/qtProjects/J1939Plugin/openSYDE-master/opensyde_tool/result/utilities/J1939_openSYDE/images/IconNodeInactive.svg', because: The system cannot find the file specified.
  - same error for maybe 4-6 other images.  i.e. IconNode.svg, IconImportFile.svg, IconMessage.svg etc.
+ Solution: did file search and copy from the other .zip version of the Qt J1939 project (the one that compiled to v. 1.6.x).
***** Experiment with running J1939 plugin
****** General Testing Steps [0/5]:
- [ ] Make new project
- [ ] Add a node (i.e. ESX-4CS-GW)
- [ ] Add a CAN bus and connect to node
- [ ] Save project
- [ ] Open Node in System Definition and Import TSP (confirm datablocks added)
  - BREAK:  When exploring J1939 UI in Bus Edit and going back to Node edit got error "Extremely Nasty Error..."  Qt closed the application.
  - APPLICATION OUTPUT: Warning: File for bus not found:  "C:/stw/qtProjects/J1939Plugin/openSYDE-master/opensyde_tool/Demo4/system_definition/Buses/NewCANBus.xml"
  - APPLICATION OUTPUT: 06:23:07: C:\stw\qtProjects\J1939Plugin\openSYDE-master\opensyde_tool\result\tool\openSYDE.exe crashed
***** Teams Meeting Today
+ Export copy of this journal to html on github [[https://github.com/0xbadc0fee/Projects-Journal/blob/master/j1939plugin.html][link]]
+ Teams test call, (re-check audio and mic every time.)
+ Go over list of any questions re: Qt Creator, J1939 Plugin, etc

- [ ] Confirm new .a file generated and stored in correct build directory
***** BACKFILL NOTES TOMORROW MORNING!
+ ADD TREE STRUCTURE SNAPSHOTS
+ ADD NOTES ABOUT SCRAPPING AND REBUILDING
  + PROBLEM: j1939 portion was not creating .dll file when building.
  + PROBLEM: when running in openSYDE, j1939 plugin tasks triggered "widget not found" in application output

+ Ideally would have included xml header url, but had trouble parsing the string text of url in C++ / Qt Creator.
  + per section 2.8 of the XML 1.0 Standard, adding declaration (header) is _optional_, so leaving out.
  + NOTE: per section 2.8 of XML 1.1 Standard, declaration is mandatory, so if possilb should be ready?
    #+begin_src C++
    QString fileName = pluginDirectorySave + "j1939_library.xml" ;
    //SGC CODE HERE: Check that lib exists if not, make one
    QFile *xmlFile = new QFile(fileName);
    if (!xmlFile->exists()){
        vector <J1939Message> emptyMessage = {};
        J1939Message * emptyXml = new J1939Message();

*** 2024-01-31 Wednesday
**** Begin OPSYD-37 Add PGN Update Fields
:LOGBOOK:
CLOCK: [2024-01-31 Wed 06:05]
:END:
***** TODO PGN Updates [0/3]
- [ ] TX Methods:
  - [ ] Cyclic
  - [ ] On Change
  - [ ] On Event
  - [ ] Update Generated C files
- [ ] SPN scaling and offset, Update Generated C files.
- [ ] Configurable CANID
***** Change Notes:
+ Look for var mappings in three groups *xmlFile <-> Database <-> UI*
  + use Qt advanced find regex for variable pairs, i.e. regex = .*?pgnUpdate\b.*?\bPGNNumber
+ target sections of code, used search "NewMessage"
  + see J1939PGNLibrary.cpp for *->setPlaceholderText("NewMessage")*
  + see J1939plugin.cpp for *pgnUpdate = new J1939EditMessage(emTable,...,emFormGroupBoxAdd);*
  + see *QGroupBox *J1939PGNLibrary::PGNFormGroup(pgnEdit * pgnUpdate)*
+ PGN Update UI form variables
  + pgnUpdate->PGNName 
  + pgnUpdate->PGNNumber
  + pgnUpdate->dlcSB
  + pgnUpdate-<txRate
  + Group Box = QgroupBox *J1939PGNLibrary::PGNFormGroup(...)
+ PGN Update DB form variables
  + PGNname
  + PGNnum
  + PGNDLC
  + PGNTXRate
  + CLASS = pgnLib
    + setters, i.e. = void setPGNname(...) {...};
    + getters, i.e. = string getSPGNname(...) {...};
+ SPN Update UI form variables (look for addSPNSet)
  + addSPNSet->emSPNName
  + addSPNSet->emSPNNumber
  + addSPNSet->emSPNDataFormatCB
  + addSPNSet->emSPNHighVV
  + addSPNSet->emSPNStartBytes
  + Group Box = QGroupBox* J1939PGNLibrary::SPNFormGroup(...)
+ SPN Update DB form variables
  + SPNName
  + SPNNumber
  + SPNDataFormatCB
  + SPNHighVV
  + mSPNStartByte
  + CLASS = spnLib
    + setters, i.e. = void setSPNName(...) {...};
    + getters, i.e. = string getSPNName(..) {...};
+ XML Load PGN variables
  + vector <pgnLib> pgnList;
  + string PGNName = "",PGNNumber = "", DLC "", 
+ XML Load SPN variables
  + vector <spnLib> spnList = {}; //reading XML file initally creates empty vector for storing SPN's into on read
  + string SPNName = "",SPNNumber = "", DataFormat = "", HighestVV = "", StartingByte = "";
+ XML Read / Write
  + basic read in flow is [ XML -> QXmlStreamReader -> QString variable -> Std String variable -> PGNName (UI) ]
    + ?? on save, PGNName (UI) mapped to PGNname (DB)
